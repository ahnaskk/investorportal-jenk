                      <h3>SBA Loan</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>SBA loans are government-guaranteed, long-term loans made by SBA lenders that allow businesses who may have been turned down by the bank to receive low-interest rate loans that can be used for many business purposes. </p>
                      </div>

                      <h3>Traditional-Term Business Loan</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>Just like a traditional bank loan, with a traditional-term business loan, you are lent a set amount upfront, which you pay back (along with fees) over a set period of time. </p>
                      </div>

                      <h3>Equipment Financing</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>With equipment financing, the lender will upfront you cash to help purchase the equipment outright. You then pay back the total amount lent, plus fees, for a set period of time. </p>
                      </div>

                      <h3>Business Line Of Credit</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>With a business line of credit, a financial institution gives you a credit limit, or a maximum amount of capital you are able to draw on at any given time. Just like a credit card, you only pay interest on the amount you use.</p>
                      </div>

                      <h3>Invoice Financing</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>Invoice financing allows you to sell your invoices to a lender, who will then upfront you a large majority of the invoice amount, holding a remaining percent (usually 20%) until the invoice is paid. </p>
                      </div>

                      <h3>Short-Term Business Loan</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>With a short-term business loan, you are lent a set amount upfront, which you quickly pay back (along with fees) over a short period of time. </p>
                      </div>

                      <h3>Merchant Cash Advance</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>Merchant cash advance is a business loan where the lender up fronts you a set amount of cash and then you repay this advance (plus their fee) with a set percent of your daily credit card sales. </p>
                      </div>

                      <h3>Startup Loan</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>Our three startup loan products can help your young business get the capital needed to grow. These two products (business line of credit and equipment financing) are a more traditional form of startup capital and a great option if you have a strong personal credit score. </p>
                      </div>

                      <h3>Personal Loan for Business</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>A lot of people don’t know that you can actually use a personal loan for business purposes. Personal loans are especially helpful for new businesses that don’t have a long financial history to show lenders. Personal loans can often have lower interest rates than some business loans, making it a great option for young companies looking for financing to grow their business. </p>
